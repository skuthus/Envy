# Envy

A fast, frictionless note-taking app for macOS. One search box, instant results, and notes stored as plain `.md` files you can grep, sync, or edit with anything else you like.

## Download

Get the latest signed, notarized build at **[envynote.app](https://envynote.app)** — click "Download for Mac" for a ready-to-run `.dmg`. Envy updates itself after that (Envy menu → "Check for Updates…"), so there's no need to come back here for new versions.

This repository is published for source transparency. The code is proprietary (see [License](#license)) — Envy isn't intended to be built or packaged by anyone but its maintainer, so there are deliberately no build instructions here.

## Features

- **Instant search-driven workflow** — type to filter notes as you type; press Return to open the top match or create a new note from your search text if nothing matches.
- **Flat-file storage** — every note is a plain `.md` file on disk. No database, no proprietary format.
- **Live markdown styling** — headings, bold, italic, strikethrough, code, lists, task checkboxes, footnotes, and blockquotes all render directly in the editor as you type, no separate preview mode. A plain-text mode toggle shows the raw markdown instead when you want it.
- **Wiki-links** — link notes with `[[Note Title]]`; ⌘-click to follow a link, which creates the target note on the spot if it doesn't exist yet.
- **Tags** — write `#tag` anywhere in a note and Envy picks it up automatically, rendered bold with a tinted background. Search `tag:name` to filter by it, including partial matches.
- **Date search** — `date:today`, `date:week`, `date:month`, or an exact date in whatever format you'd naturally type it.
- **Scattered multi-word search** — search several words at once and Envy finds notes containing all of them anywhere in the text, not just as one phrase.
- **Pinning** — pin a note to keep it at the top of the list regardless of sort. A search that doesn't match a pinned note still hides it, same as any other note.
- **Live external-edit detection** — editing a note in another app while it's open in Envy updates it automatically, with the changed portion briefly flashing so you don't miss it.
- **Multiple note folders** — merge notes from more than one folder into a single searchable list, with per-folder cycling.
- **Undo a delete** — deleted notes go to Trash, not gone for good, and can be restored right back where they were.
- **Fully remappable shortcuts** — every keyboard shortcut in the app can be customized in Settings → Shortcuts.
- **Global hotkey** — `⌥⌘↩` shows or hides Envy from anywhere, even when another app is focused.
- **Themes & appearance** — customizable fonts and colors (including per-syntax-element colors), adjustable window blur, note list density, and independent System/Light/Dark mode.
- **Open at login** — optional toggle to launch Envy automatically when you log in.

## Notes Storage

By default, notes live in `~/Documents/Envy`. This folder (and any additional folders you configure in Settings → General) is created automatically on first launch, along with a welcome note covering the basics.

## Project Structure

- `Sources/VelocityCore` — the note model and `NoteStore` data layer (platform-agnostic)
- `Sources/Envy` — the SwiftUI app
- `Sources/IconGenerator` — standalone tool that renders the app icon
- `Sources/VelocitySelfCheck` — a manual assertion-based check suite (used in place of Swift Testing, which doesn't run reliably without a full Xcode install)
